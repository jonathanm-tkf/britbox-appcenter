        <h2 id="6-subscription-billing-registration-and-cancellation">6. Subscription, Billing, Registration and Cancellation</h2>
        <p><strong>Subscription</strong>:  While we may offer access to some Content for free or with the viewing of advertisements, we charge a monthly or annual fee to access the Services that requires a subscription.  Your subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.  You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid credit card or other method of payment accepted by BritBox (“Payment Method”) to utilize your subscription.  You agree that your subscription is for personal use only, that we may limit the number of simultaneous streams and the number of devices by which you may access the Services, and that the Services may be accessed and utilized only through devices located in the United States and Canada.  We may offer different subscription plans, including differing conditions and limitations.  You can find specific details regarding your subscription in the Account Details section of the Services.  We reserve the right to modify or terminate our offered subscription plans at any time.</p>
        <p><strong>Billing</strong>:  You authorize us and our payment processor to charge your monthly and/or annual subscription fee at the then current rate, any other charges you may incur in connection with your access to and use of the Services, as well as any applicable taxes to your Payment Method.  You also authorize us and our payment processor to place a test charge on your Payment Method; we do not charge you in connection with this test charge.  We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our Services at any time in our sole and absolute discretion.  Any changes to your subscription fee will take effect following email notice to you. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to us.  If you want to change or update your Payment Method, you must edit your Payment Method information by navigating to the Account Details section of <a href="/account/edit">/account/edit</a> or, if you pay for the Services through your account on a third-party platform, by modifying the payment instructions on the platform you use to pay for the Services.  If your Payment Method expires, has insufficient funds, is deactivated or otherwise does not make payment and you do not update your Payment Method or cancel your subscription, you authorize us and our payment processor to continue billing and to contact your Payment Method provider to obtain updated information at our option, and you will remain responsible for any unpaid amounts.  For certain Payment Methods, your Payment Method provider may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges; you are responsible for all of these charges.</p>
        <p><strong>Cancellation</strong>:  You may cancel your BritBox subscription at any time.  If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will be effective at the end of the current billing period.  You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid being billed for the next subscription period’s subscription fee.  You can see your next renewal date by navigating to the Account Details section of <a href="/">britbox.com</a> or the third-party platform you use to access and pay for the Services.  To cancel your subscription, go to the Account Details section of Britbox at <a href="/account/edit">/account/edit</a>.  If you pay for the Services through your account on a third-party platform, then you must cancel your subscription on the third-party platform you use to pay for the Services.</p>
        <p><strong>No Refunds or Credits</strong>:  PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS.  Following any cancellation, you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your current billing period provided that you had previously paid for that period.</p>

Your decision to opt-out of this arbitration provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with BritBox or the delivery of Services to you.</p>
        <p><strong>Exclusions</strong>. YOU AND BRITBOX AGREE THAT THE FOLLOWING CLAIMS OR DISPUTES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION:</p>
