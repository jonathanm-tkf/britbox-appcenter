          <p>We offer 1-year gift subscriptions as a great gift for all, whether they're new to BritBox or are already a subscriber.</p>
          <p>A 1-year gift subscription to BritBox is $69.99 in the US and $89.99 in Canada (the price difference accounts for differences in exchange rates) and includes 12 months' access to great British telly on BritBox.

          <h3 id="how-does-billing-work">How does billing work?</h3>
          <p>The credit card you have on file in your account will be billed automatically each month or annually on the same day as your original subscription, after the initial trial period is over. Your BritBox subscription will automatically renew each month unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of your billing cycle.</p>

          <h3 id="what-tax-applies-to-my-subscription">What tax applies to my subscription?</h3>
          <p>Sales tax is charged if the zip (or postal code) on your account's payment method is located in a state requires sales tax to be charged on digital video subscriptions. The tax rate is determined by your county or state and varies.</p>
          <p>Tax is required in Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin,  Quebec and Sasketchewan.</p>
          <p>You can update the billing zip on your BritBox account by logging in to your account and updating your payment method's zip or postal code. Changes are effective from the next subscription renewal.</p>
